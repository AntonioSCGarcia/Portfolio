#### 1. Configuring a Secure Stream of Leads: How to secure your organization by managing and protecting what leads your users have access to
- [X] Situation

  A hotel company is dealing with Web-to-Lead forms, where the information is mapped from the website enquiry fields (HTML form) to a single list view of the Lead object in Salesforce. Frequent staff rotation and the distance between property locations made it difficult to fairly assign leads to sales reps, resulting in leads being contacted by several agents in the same week and neglecting SLAs.

- [X] Task

  The challenge was to build a solution that automatically assigns and distributes leads from various sources (emails, web pages, calls, etc.) and restricts access to specific list views for each team. This also involved simplifying the user interface and instructing the team to access relevant data.

      
- [X] Action

  Using Salesforce’s Object Manager and Lightning App Builder, I designed the Web-to-Lead form to map new information, using Territory Management allows the categorization of lead locations and accurate capture of lead information. I then configured assignment rules to allocate the leads to the appropriate teams based on predefined criteria such as source and location. Additionally, I customized the Lightning App to streamline tab access and list views, ensuring each team could easily access only the leads relevant to their specific hotel location. I also configured escalation rules and urgent queues to handle neglected leads promptly. Security settings were configured to maintain record view/edit access for specific roles high in the hierarchy. 

      
- [X] Results

  The implementation of assignment rules, list views, and custom web fields resulted in a significant improvement in lead management efficiency. The Territory Management
      by business property now enhances forecasting accuracy, and teams can now receive and access leads automatically and in real time, reducing the time spent on manual assignments. This approach also encouraged sales executives to own their pipeline as their teams only received suitable, pre-categorized leads.

#### 2. How to leverage Email to Case, Einstein Activity Capture (EAC) and custom fields to obtain email engagement metrics between leads and SF users.

- [X] Situation
      
  The sales team relied heavily on a single info@email address, a shortcut to track email interactions for all team members at once. However, the individual reps. engagement and the expiration of the Outlook Salesforce add-on markets this set-up obsolete. With raw data unified activities from EAC and SF features still unused, there was a need to implement a system to count and track email interactions more effectively.

- [X] Task

  Crack the Email to Case, and Einstein Activity (AWS) metrics to master the visualization of email interaction per pipeline. Also, evaluate how shifting from using the info@email address to individual executive emails would challenge the business processes.

- [X] Action

  Using Salesforce’s Email to Case, I created several trigger flows to populate new custom fields to count email interactions for each lead (emails sent vs emails received). Enabling the Activity Timeline and custom reports, I can materialise these metrics in Custom Dashboards, and showcase the engagement behaviour distribution in charts across each pipeline. 

- [X] Results
  Sales representatives can now see detailed interaction metrics with their open lead (metric components) and can realise when somebody sporadically absent from the team needs help to meet email SLA standards.

  <img width="921" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-29 at 22 33 46" src="https://github.com/AntonioSCGarcia/Portfolio/assets/107673009/f424eaba-af14-4af1-ad40-146c0e7b7576">


#### 3. How to automate lead responses and field updates with auto-response emails

- [X] Situation

  The sales team was manually replying to web inquiries, which wasted time in those cases where the lead was unresponsive and led to inconsistent communication. There was a need to     save time on presales but ensure timely replies, also the lead status could be reflected more accurately as it moved through the sales funnel. The goal was to streamline communication with potential leads while automating key status updates based on the responses received.

- [X] Task

  To implement a pre-defined email template as the first communication attempt. This flow should automatically continue sending follow-up templates until the lead replies. When the lead responds, the system should update the Lead status and several standard and custom fields to reflect the lead’s progression in the sales cycle ("such as last communication date").

      
- [X] Action

  Using Salesforce's Flow Builder and Auto-reply Email Templates, I set up a record trigger flow chain that starts with an initial auto-response email to web inquiries. The system then schedules a series of follow-up emails that are automatically sent until the lead replies. Once a response is received, the prospect is considered to be a hot lead, and the status is updated from "Attempt" to "Working", and additional related fields—such as number of attempts or time response are also updated automatically.

      
- [X] Results

  The sales team now benefits from an automated, hands-off approach to initial lead communications. This automation has significantly improved response times and accuracy of the pipeline stages, ensuring no web inquiry is left unattended, and allowed sales representatives to focus only on hot leads.


#### 4. How to implement a screen flow for guided data capture during sales calls

- [X] Situation
      
  In the call center, new sales representatives often struggled to maintain consistent conversations during phone calls, leading to missed data entries and inconsistent customer experiences. There was a need to introduce a solution that would help guide representatives through their calls while ensuring all relevant data was captured accurately and efficiently.

- [X] Task

  By my own initiative, I propose developing a screen flow in Salesforce that could serve two key purposes: helping sales reps follow a structured conversation during calls and ensuring that they record the necessary information in Salesforce. The flow needed to be intuitive, adaptable to various call scenarios, and flexible enough to guide both experienced reps and new hires.

- [X] Action

  I built a multi-step screen flow in Salesforce using Flow Builder, which guided the sales reps through each stage of a customer call. The flow incorporated dynamic prompts based on customer responses, helping reps navigate through the conversation with ease. At each stage, the flow provided a baseline script (keywords) for what to say, ensuring that the conversation stayed on track. Additionally, the flow required the reps to input key data points (such as customer feedback, product interests, and follow-up details) at the appropriate moments, preventing data gaps (including validation rules with error messages). I also incorporated decision branches so the flow could adapt to different scenarios based on the customer's responses, such as interest level or objections.

- [X] Results
      
  New sales representatives are now able to follow a more controlled and consistent script during phone calls, which has improved customer interactions and increased data accuracy. The guided flow has reduced training time for new hires, allowing them to quickly become proficient in managing calls. The structured approach has also led to better overall customer satisfaction and more accurate data collection, giving management more reliable insights into call performance and outcomes.

#### 5. Implementing Full Forecasting Features in Salesforce Sales Cloud

- [X] Situation

  The sales leadership team was struggling with unreliable and inconsistent sales forecasts. Different regions and teams were using varied methods to predict revenue, leading to fragmented and often inaccurate projections. Sales leaders lacked visibility into the overall pipeline health, making it difficult to plan for resources or set realistic sales targets. The company needed a more structured and centralized approach to forecasting to drive better decision-making and alignment across teams.

- [X] Task

  I was tasked with implementing Salesforce's forecasting features to provide the sales leadership team with a unified, accurate view of future revenue. This would involve configuring collaborative forecasts, setting up forecast categories, enabling quota tracking, and providing managers with the ability to adjust forecasts in real-time. The system needed to be adaptable to different sales teams, products, and regions, while also allowing for flexibility in forecasting based on specific sales cycles.

- [X] Action

  I started by working closely with the sales leadership team to understand the nuances of their sales processes, revenue cycles, and the KPIs they wanted to track. From there, I:
  
  Configured Collaborative Forecasting: I set up collaborative forecasting to ensure all sales reps could contribute to their team's forecasts. I worked on defining the appropriate forecast types (e.g., revenue, quantity) based on the organization's product lines and service offerings. These forecasts were then grouped by regions, products, and teams, providing a consolidated view for the sales leaders.

  Defined Forecast Categories: I aligned forecast categories with the sales cycle stages (Pipeline, Best Case, Commit, and Closed) so that sales reps could accurately classify their opportunities. This allowed the leadership team to see potential revenue breakdowns by stage and likelihood of closing.

  Enabled Quotas and Forecast Adjustments: I implemented quota management to help the sales managers assign specific revenue targets to individual reps and teams. I also enabled forecast adjustments, allowing managers to make real-time modifications based on insights or changing circumstances without losing visibility into the original forecasts.

  Automated Reports and Dashboards: To ensure real-time visibility, I created custom reports and dashboards that pulled forecast data by various dimensions—such as region, product line, and sales stage—allowing for quick analysis of where revenue was expected to come from. These reports also included variance analysis, showing the difference between initial forecasts and actual performance.

  Implemented Forecasting for Custom Metrics: Since the company also tracked recurring revenue and renewal contracts, I configured custom objects and fields to capture these elements within the forecasts. This provided a more holistic view of expected revenue beyond just one-time sales.


- [X] Results

  The forecasting project led to a significant improvement in the company’s ability to predict future revenue. With the unified system in place, sales leaders could now access real-time data on their pipelines and adjust forecasts dynamically based on market changes or rep performance. The accuracy of the forecasts improved by 30%, and the sales team was able to meet their quotas more consistently. Leadership gained a clearer understanding of where to focus resources and how to better allocate sales efforts.

  The automated dashboards allowed managers to make data-driven decisions quickly, reducing the time spent manually compiling forecast reports by 60%. The improved forecast visibility also helped in setting more realistic targets for the next quarter, reducing the stress and uncertainty previously felt by both sales teams and management.
