### Master Thesis | Competitor Analysis and Customer Segmentation in the Built to Rent Revenue Management (_January 2024_)								       		

This study delves into the intricacies of customer segmentation, conversion rates, and competitive analysis, aiming to develop a data-driven marketing strategy tailored for the Built to Rent (BTR) sector in London, UK. It seeks to answer the pivotal research question: How can we integrate internal sales data from Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Property Management Systems (PMS) with external competitor pricing data from Analytica? The context is a real-life start-up scenario within the niche of Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA), closely linked with university housing. The project underscores the significance of automating data collection through web scraping and harnessing machine learning techniques, including clustering and predicting sales attrition, utilizing customer transactional records. The culmination of this effort is the production of an interactive dashboard that not only visualizes the data but also encapsulates the findings of this comprehensive analysis in a transferable business intelligence solution. This document compiles and articulates the insights and technical nuances across three distinct models and five diverse datasets, encompassing over fifty-nine features and a plethora of computed metrics. It also details the integration of two complete data processing streams, presenting them in a fluid and coherent manner. This report encapsulates the methodological approach, the analytical journey, and the strategic outcomes, all aimed at bolstering the marketing efficacy within the dynamic BTR landscape.
