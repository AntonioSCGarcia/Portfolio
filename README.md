  "This Power BI visualization utilizes a packed bubble chart to strategically segment customers within the build-to-rent (BTR) sector using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model.
Bubble size likely reflects total resident transaction value (Monetary), while positioning along the X/Y axes indicates renewal recency and frequency. This analysis offers actionable insights by uncovering valuable customer segments and patterns within resident behavior, facilitating data-driven decision-making to optimize marketing and resident retention strategies in the BTR industry"

- Data Mining and Machine Learning | Building an Ensemble Model over Facebook metrics | (_May 2023_)

  "In this paper, I evaluate the performance of several well-known machine learning techniques for predicting the impact of Facebook posts. The models investigated include k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR).
Social media platforms exert a significant influence on social behavior. Developing an automatic model to predict the impact of social media posts can support managers' decisions on whether to publish content, potentially enhancing engagement and reach. This analysis could be complemented with sensitivity analysis to provide further insights."

## 1. Configuring a Secure Stream of Leads

#### " How to secure your organization by managing and protecting what leads your users have access to"
- [X] Situation

  A hotel company is dealing with Web-to-Lead forms, where the information is mapped from the website enquiry fields (HTML form) to a single list view of the Lead object in Salesforce. Frequent staff rotation and the distance between property locations made it difficult to fairly assign leads to sales reps, resulting in leads being contacted by several agents in the same week and neglecting SLAs.

- [X] Task

  The challenge was to build a solution that automatically assigns and distributes leads from various sources (emails, web pages, calls, etc.) and restricts access to specific list views for each team. This also involved simplifying the user interface and instructing the team to access relevant data.

      
- [X] Action

  Using Salesforceâ€™s Object Manager and Lightning App Builder, I designed the Web-to-Lead form to map new information, using Territory Management allows the categorization of lead locations and accurate capture of lead information. I then configured assignment rules to allocate the leads to the appropriate teams based on predefined criteria such as source and location. Additionally, I customized the Lightning App to streamline tab access and list views, ensuring each team could easily access only the leads relevant to their specific hotel location. I also configured escalation rules and urgent queues to handle neglected leads promptly. Security settings were configured to maintain record view/edit access for specific roles high in the hierarchy. 

      
- [X] Results

  The implementation of assignment rules, list views, and custom web fields resulted in a significant improvement in lead management efficiency. The Territory Management
      by business property now enhances forecasting accuracy, and teams can now receive and access leads automatically and in real time, reducing the time spent on manual assignments. This approach also encouraged sales executives to own their pipeline as their teams only received suitable, pre-categorized leads.

#### How to leverage Einstein Activity Capture (EAC) and custom formula fields to count email interactions and enhance lead engagement.

- [X] Situation
      
  The sales team relied heavily on a single info@email address, a shortcut to track email interactions for all team members at once. However, the individual reps. engagement and the expiration of the Outlook Salesforce add-on markets this organization obsolete. With raw data available from EAC, there was a need to implement a system to count and track email interactions more effectively.

- [X] Task

  Crack the Einstein Activity metrics capture and master the visualization of email interaction per pipeline. Also, evaluate how shifting from using the info@email address to individual executive emails would challenge the business processes.

- [X] Action

  Using Salesforceâ€™s Object Manager, I created custom formula fields to count email interactions for each lead. Enabling the Einstein Analytics in settings, I can materialise these metrics in Custom Reports, therefore populate the formula fields and showcase the metrics and email engagement distribution charts across dashboards. 

- [X] Results
  Sales representatives can now see detailed interaction metrics for each lead (formula fields) and can monitor the engagement of their pipeline (dashboard).
